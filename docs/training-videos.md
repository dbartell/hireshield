## Course 1: AI in Hiring 101 (3 videos)

### 1.1 What is AI in Hiring? (2 min)

**HOOK:** "That resume screening tool your team uses every day? It's probably AI. And in 2026, that means you need to tell candidates about it."

**SCRIPT:**
AI in hiring isn't just robots conducting interviews. It's any automated system that:
- Screens resumes or applications
- Scores candidates on skills or fit
- Analyzes video interviews
- Chatbots that ask screening questions
- Predicts which candidates will succeed

If a tool touches candidate data and influences who gets hired, it likely counts as AI under the new laws.

**VISUAL:** Show examples of common tools (Greenhouse, HireVue, Pymetrics logos — blurred/generic)

**CTA:** "Next up: we'll show you the most common AI tools you're probably already using."

---

### 1.2 Common AI Hiring Tools (3 min)

**SCRIPT:**
Let's walk through what's in your stack:

**ATS Systems** — Most modern ATS platforms auto-rank candidates. That's AI.
[Show: Greenhouse/Lever-style interface with ranking]

**Video Interview Platforms** — HireVue, Spark Hire analyze facial expressions, tone, word choice.
[Show: Video interview screen with analysis overlay]

**Skills Assessments** — Codility, HackerRank, TestGorilla use algorithms to score responses.
[Show: Coding test interface]

**Chatbots** — Paradox, Olivia, XOR ask screening questions and filter candidates.
[Show: Chat interface example]

**Predictive Analytics** — Tools that predict "culture fit" or "likelihood to succeed."
[Show: Dashboard with prediction scores]

**Key point:** If you're not sure whether something counts as AI, assume it does. Better to disclose than to get fined.

### 1.3 Quiz Intro (30 sec)

**SCRIPT:**
"Time to test what you've learned. This quick quiz covers the basics of AI in hiring. Pass it to unlock your first certificate and move on to state-specific requirements."

---

## Course 2: State Law Requirements (4 videos)

### 2.1 Illinois Requirements (3 min)

**HOOK:** "Illinois was first. If you hire in Illinois, you've been required to comply since January 1, 2026."

**SCRIPT:**
Illinois HB 3773 — the AI Video Interview Act expanded:

**You MUST:**
1. Notify candidates BEFORE using AI
2. Explain what AI evaluates (skills, personality, etc.)
3. Offer an alternative process if requested
4. Get consent before AI analysis

**Penalties:** Up to $1,000 per violation. Class action risk is real.

**Pro tip:** Use our document generator to create Illinois-compliant disclosures in 30 seconds.

### 2.2 Colorado Requirements (4 min)

**HOOK:** "Colorado's AI Act is the strictest in the country. Here's what you need to know."

**SCRIPT:**
Colorado SB 21-169 treats hiring AI as "high-risk":

**Requirements:**
1. **Impact Assessment** — Document how AI affects hiring decisions annually
2. **Risk Management** — Have a written policy for AI governance
3. **Disclosure** — Tell candidates about AI use and their right to appeal
4. **Human Override** — Must have human review available

**Timeline:** Fully effective February 1, 2026

[Show: AIHireLaw audit tool generating Colorado impact assessment]

**The big one:** Colorado requires you to explain how candidates can contest AI-assisted decisions.

---

### 2.3 NYC Requirements (3 min)

**SCRIPT:**
NYC Local Law 144 — the AEDT law:

**Key requirements:**
1. **Annual Bias Audit** — Independent auditor must test for discrimination
2. **Public Posting** — Audit summary on your website
3. **Candidate Notice** — 10 business days before AI use
4. **Data Retention** — Keep records for 4 years

**Applies to:** Any employer using automated employment decision tools for NYC candidates

[Show: Example bias audit summary]

**Watch out:** The bias audit must be conducted by an independent third party. Self-audits don't count.

---

### 2.4 Multi-State Compliance (3 min)

**SCRIPT:**
Hiring nationally? You need to comply with the strictest law that applies.

**Quick reference:**
- California — CCPA applies to candidate data, disclosure required
- Maryland — AI video interview consent required
- Texas, Virginia, Washington — Laws in progress

**Strategy:** Build for Colorado (strictest) and you'll cover most states.

## Course 3: Writing Effective Disclosures (3 videos)

### 3.1 Disclosure Requirements (3 min)

**SCRIPT:**
A compliant disclosure must be:

1. **Clear** — No legal jargon. 8th grade reading level.
2. **Conspicuous** — Not buried in fine print
3. **Timely** — BEFORE AI processes the candidate
4. **Specific** — Name the AI tools or categories
5. **Actionable** — Tell them their rights

**Bad example:** "We may use technology in our hiring process."
**Good example:** "We use an AI-powered tool to analyze your video interview responses. You have the right to request a human-only review."

[Show: Side-by-side comparison]

---

### 3.2 Language and Accessibility (2 min)

**SCRIPT:**
Your disclosure is useless if candidates can't understand it.

**Best practices:**
- Write at an 8th grade reading level (use Hemingway Editor)
- Avoid "algorithmic" — say "automated" or "AI-powered"
- Translate for your workforce demographics
- Provide text alternatives for any video/audio
- Test with actual candidates

## Course 4: Preventing Algorithmic Bias (5 videos)

### 4.1 Understanding Algorithmic Bias (3 min)

**SCRIPT:**
AI learns from historical data. If your past hiring was biased, your AI will be too.

**Real examples:**
- Amazon scrapped an AI that downgraded women's resumes
- HireVue faced backlash for facial analysis bias
- Resume screeners penalize "ethnic-sounding" names

**The law:** NYC requires bias testing. Colorado and Illinois are following.

Bias isn't about intent. It's about outcomes. If your AI produces disparate impact, you're liable.

---

### 4.2 Sources of Bias (3 min)

**SCRIPT:**
Where does bias come from?

1. **Training Data** — If past hires were 90% male, AI learns "male = good"
2. **Proxy Variables** — Zip codes, school names, hobbies can encode race/class
3. **Feature Selection** — What you measure matters
4. **Feedback Loops** — AI reinforces its own biases over time

[Show: Diagram of bias feedback loop]

**Key insight:** Even "objective" criteria like test scores can encode historical discrimination.

---

### 4.3 Testing for Bias (4 min)

**SCRIPT:**
How to audit your AI:

1. **Adverse Impact Analysis** — Compare selection rates across demographics
2. **The 4/5ths Rule** — If a group's selection rate is below 80% of the highest group, investigate
3. **Intersectional Analysis** — Check combinations (e.g., Black women, not just Black or women)

[Show: AIHireLaw audit tool running bias analysis]

**NYC requirement:** Independent bias audit annually. We can connect you with certified auditors.

---

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategies (3 min)

**SCRIPT:**
Found bias? Here's how to fix it:

1. **Remove problematic features** — If zip code correlates with race, drop it
2. **Rebalance training data** — Ensure diverse representation
3. **Human review checkpoints** — Don't let AI make final decisions alone
4. **Regular re-testing** — Bias can creep back

**Documentation:** Keep records of what you tested, found, and fixed. This is your audit defense.

---

## Course 5: Audit Preparation (3 videos)

### 5.1 Documentation Requirements (4 min)

**SCRIPT:**
When regulators come knocking, you need:

1. **AI Inventory** — List of all AI tools in hiring
2. **Vendor Documentation** — How each tool works, what data it uses
3. **Disclosure Records** — Proof you notified candidates
4. **Consent Records** — Signed opt-ins (where required)
5. **Bias Audit Reports** — Annual testing results
6. **Remediation Records** — What you fixed and when

[Show: AIHireLaw document storage and consent tracking]

**Retention:** NYC requires 4 years. Keep everything for 5 to be safe.

---

### 5.2 Building an Audit Trail (3 min)

**SCRIPT:**
An audit trail proves you did things right:

- **Timestamp everything** — When disclosures were sent, consents received
- **Version control** — Keep old versions of policies and disclosures
- **Log AI decisions** — Which candidates were screened out by AI
- **Track human overrides** — When humans reversed AI recommendations

[Show: AIHireLaw consent tracking with full history]

**Pro tip:** If it's not documented, it didn't happen. Regulators don't take your word for it.
