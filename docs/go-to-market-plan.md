## Phase 3: Outreach Sequences

### 3.1 LinkedIn Connection Request (First Touch)

**Version A - Direct:**
```
Hi [First Name] - saw you're heading up HR at [Company]. With the new AI hiring laws hitting Illinois and Colorado, I'm helping HR teams get compliant before the fines start. Worth a quick chat?
```

**Version B - Value First:**
```
Hi [First Name] - built a free compliance scorecard for AI hiring tools (takes 2 min). Thought it might be useful given the new state laws. Happy to share if helpful.
```

**Version C - Question:**
```
Hi [First Name] - curious if [Company] is using any AI in your hiring process? The new disclosure laws are catching a lot of HR teams off guard.
```

### 3.2 LinkedIn Follow-Up (If Connected, No Reply - Day 3)

```
Hey [First Name] - quick question: are you using any automated tools in hiring? Resume screening, video interviews, assessments, etc?

Illinois and Colorado now require disclosure to candidates, and NYC requires annual bias audits. 

I built a tool that handles this in 10 minutes. Happy to show you if useful - no pitch, just a walkthrough.

[Calendly Link]
```

### 3.3 LinkedIn Follow-Up #2 (Day 7)

```
Last ping on this - put together a quick checklist of what's required by state:

✓ Illinois: Candidate disclosure + consent
✓ Colorado: Impact assessment + disclosure  
✓ NYC: Annual bias audit + public posting
✓ California: CCPA data disclosure

If you're using AI tools and hiring in any of these states, you're technically required to comply now.

Our compliance audit takes 5 min and tells you exactly where you stand: [Scorecard Link]

Either way, happy to answer any questions.
```

### 3.4 Cold Email Sequence

**Email 1 - Day 1:**
```
Subject: AI hiring compliance for [Company]

Hi [First Name],

Quick question - is [Company] using any AI or automated tools in hiring? (ATS screening, video interviews, assessments, etc.)

If yes, you're now required to disclose this to candidates in Illinois, Colorado, and NYC. Fines start at $500-$1,500 per violation.

I built AIHireLaw to help HR teams:
✓ Generate compliant disclosure documents in 2 min
✓ Track candidate consent for audit defense
✓ Stay updated when laws change

Worth a 15-min call to see if this is relevant?

[Calendly Link]

—Devyn
```

**Email 2 - Day 4 (No Reply):**
```
Subject: Re: AI hiring compliance for [Company]

Hi [First Name],

Following up - I know compliance isn't the most exciting topic, but the fines are real:

• Illinois: $1,000 per violation
• NYC: $1,500 per violation  
• Colorado: TBD but they're not messing around

If you're using any AI in hiring (most companies are without realizing it), takes 2 min to check: [Scorecard Link]

Happy to walk through results with you.

—Devyn
```

**Email 3 - Day 7 (No Reply):**
```
Subject: Last one - AI hiring compliance

Hi [First Name],

I'll keep this short - if [Company] uses any automated hiring tools and you're not sure about compliance, I'm offering a free 15-min compliance review this month.

No pitch. Just tell you where you stand and what you need to do.

[Calendly Link]

If this isn't relevant, no worries - just let me know and I'll stop bugging you.

—Devyn

## Phase 4: Phone/Call Scripts

### Discovery Call Script (15-30 min)

**Opening (2 min):**
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. Before I dive into anything, I'd love to understand your situation. Can you tell me a bit about how [Company] handles hiring today?"

**Discovery Questions (10 min):**
1. "What tools do you use in your hiring process?" (ATS, assessments, video interviews)
2. "Which states do you hire in?"
3. "Are you aware of the new AI disclosure laws in Illinois and Colorado?"
4. "Have you had to deal with any compliance audits before?"
5. "Who handles compliance documentation at [Company]?"
6. "What would happen if you got hit with a compliance complaint?"

**Pain Agitation (3 min):**
"So you're using [tools] and hiring in [states]. Under the new laws, you're required to:
- Notify every candidate before AI processes their application
- Get consent in some states
- Have documentation ready for audits

Most companies I talk to are either unaware or think it doesn't apply to them. Then they get a complaint and scramble."

**Solution (5 min):**
"What I built does three things:
1. Generates compliant disclosure documents for your states in 2 minutes
2. Tracks consent so you have proof for audits
3. Alerts you when laws change so you don't fall behind

The companies using this spend 10 minutes/quarter staying compliant instead of 10 hours with lawyers."

**Close (5 min):**
"Based on what you've told me, you'd need [X documents] and should be tracking consent for [Y candidates/month].

Our Pro plan at $499/mo would cover that. Compared to one $500/hr lawyer consultation, you're saving money in the first month.

Would you like to start with a pilot?"

### Objection Handling

**"We don't use AI in hiring"**
→ "Do you use an ATS that screens resumes? Video interview software? Skills assessments? Those all count as AI under these laws."

**"Our legal team handles this"**
→ "Great - have they generated the state-specific disclosures yet? We can save them 10+ hours and they can review what we produce."

**"We're too small to worry about this"**
→ "The laws apply to any employer using AI tools, regardless of size. And smaller companies are often targeted first because they're less likely to fight back."

**"Can I think about it?"**
→ "Of course. What specifically would you need to think through? I want to make sure I've answered everything."

**"It's too expensive"**
→ "What's your budget? We have a Starter plan at $199/mo. And one violation is $1,000+, so it pays for itself if it prevents even one complaint."

**"We're already compliant"**
→ "That's great! Mind if I ask - what documentation do you have? We see a lot of companies who think they're covered but are missing state-specific requirements."

## Phase 6: LinkedIn Content (1 Post/Day)

### Post Templates:

**Post 1 - The Wake-Up Call:**
```
Illinois' AI hiring law went into effect January 1, 2026.

If you use ANY of these in hiring:
• Resume screening software
• Video interview analysis
• Skills assessments
• Chatbots

You're now required to disclose this to candidates.

Most HR teams I talk to don't even know this law exists.

The fine? $1,000 per violation.

If you hired 100 people last year without disclosure, that's $100,000 in potential fines.

Check if you're compliant: [Link]
```

**Post 2 - The Myth Buster:**
```
"We don't use AI in hiring."

I hear this all the time. Then I ask:

• Do you use Greenhouse, Lever, or Workday? (AI screening)
• Do you use HireVue or Spark Hire? (AI analysis)
• Do you use Codility or HackerRank? (AI scoring)

The answer is almost always yes.

Under new laws in IL, CO, and NYC - that counts as AI.

And you need to tell candidates.
```

**Post 3 - The Case Study:**
```
A company with 200 employees.
Using AI video interviews.
Hiring in Illinois.

Without disclosure: $200,000 potential fine.
With AIHireLaw: $499/month.

The math isn't hard.

Yet most HR teams don't know they're exposed.
```

**Post 4 - The Question:**
```
HR leaders: Quick poll.

Do you know if your company is compliant with:
• Illinois HB 3773
• Colorado AI Act
• NYC Local Law 144

These laws require disclosure when using AI in hiring.

Comment "yes" or "no" - curious how many people are aware.
```

- Shift to phone calls

**If calls but no closes:**
- Lower price to $99/mo pilot
- Offer money-back guarantee
- Ask what's blocking the decision

**If people say "not relevant":**
- Ask more qualifying questions upfront
- Target different industries
- Double down on staffing agencies (they definitely use AI)

## Let's Go

The only way this fails is if we don't execute.

50 messages tomorrow.
100 messages by Friday.
5 calls by next week.
1 customer by end of month.

Who better than us, right?
